OpenShift Behavior Driven Development Demo 
==========================================

Demonstration of how behavior driven development can be applied in a containerized environment

Please look at the README in docker/business-central/support and follow the instructions to aquire the BRMS deployable

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate how CI/CD, DevOps and behavior driven development can be executed in a containerized environment. For the purposes of this demonstration, we will be using a rules-based application and seeing how this can be done with an application with externalized business logic.

By combining the power of containerized environments and core DevOps concepts, we are able to control code quality while maintaining a rapid turnaround time to deploying the latest code additions to higher environments.

## Core Technologies Demonstrated

OpenShift Enterprise
Docker
Jenkins
Cucumber
Red Hat JBoss BPMS


## Concepts Highlighted

Cloud Based Architecture
Platform as a Service
DevOps
Continuous Integration
Continuous Delivery
Behavior Driven Development
Specification by Example


## Persistent Volume Requirements

To ensure state is stored within various components of the infrastructure, OpenShift persistent volumes will be utilized. The Red Hat CDK contains 3 persistent volumes out of the box, but at least 5 are required. Perform the following steps to ensure at least 5 persistent volumes are available.

Login to the Red Hat CDK and sudo up to root

```
vagrant ssh
sudo su -
```
 
Login to OpenShift using the admin account

    oc login -u admin -p admin --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true localhost:8443

Check the number of persistent volumes available

    oc get pv
    
Use the following section to create a persistent volume in order to satisfy the minimum requirements

### Create additional persistent storage

Creating additional persistent storage requires first adding a new export to the NFS share and then adding a persistent volume to OpenShift referencing the newly created share

#### Creating a new NFS Export

The CDK stores NFS shares in the `/nfsvolumes` directory in folders `pvXX` where XX indicates the number. In this scenario, persistent volume 04 will be created.

Execute the following commands to configure the NFS server with the additional share

```
mkdir /nfsvolumes/pv04
chmod -R 777 /nfsvolumes/pv04
chown -R nfsnobody:nfsnobody /nfsvolumes/pv04
echo "/nfsvolumes/pv04 *(rw,root_squash)" >> /etc/exports
exportfs -r
```

#### Create the new Persistent Volume

Execute the following command to create the new Persistent Volume

```
oc create -f- <<PV
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: pv04
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  - ReadWriteMany
  capacity:
    storage: 2Gi
  nfs:
    path: /nfsvolumes/pv04
    server: localhost
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
PV
```
