OpenShift Behavior Driven Development Demo - Demonstration Script
=================================================================


Overview
========
This document describes how to run the demonstration to highlight all the key technologies and concepts (refer to the README).
This assumes that the project is up and running on a local machine as per the Runbook.


Demo Agenda
===========
This section provides a high-level agenda for the demo. The paranthesis after each discuss what concepts are highlighted in that portion.

1. Discuss what the application is. (BPMS, Behavior Driven Development)
2. Show that the application is up and running in a stable state. (OpenShift Enterprise, Jenkins, CI/CD, DevOps)
3. Change the business requirments. (Behavior Driven Development)
4. Change the logic. (BPMS)
5. See the changes get applied. (OpenShift Enterprise, CI/CD, DevOps)
6. Deploy to a higher environment. (OpenShift Enterprise, CI/CD, DevOps)


Step by Step Instructions
=========================
TODO: This section needs to be cleaned up and expanded upon

This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to run the demonstration.

1. Describe the application and use case.
	a. Discuss the basic architecture of the application.
	b. Mention how the application talks to BPMS.
2. Show the application up and running in OpenShift Enterprise.
3. Go over the Jenkins pipelines.
	a. Show how Jenkins lets us deploy the application to environments.
	b. Highlight that the build is currently stable.
4. Change the business requirments.
	a. Update the cost of shipping for orders under $25 in the BDD scenarions only.
	b. Commit and push the new scenarios.
	c. Watch the Jenkins builds now fail.
5. Change the logic.
	a. Now that we know our application doesn't match our requirements, fix the application.
	b. Commit and push the changes.
	c. Watch Jenkins pass.
6. Once Jenkins is all green, we can deploy the application to higher environments (System testing, Production, etc.).
